MeetingBot is a comprehensive open-source **meeting intelligence platform** that automatically joins your video calls on **Zoom**, **Google Meet**, and **Microsoft Teams** to provide AI-powered **transcriptions, summaries, and actionable insights**. This project demonstrates how to build a SaaS platform with advanced AI integrations using **Gemini** and **Pinecone** for conversational meeting intelligence.

## Overview

MeetingBot allows real-time calendar sync to automatically schedule bots for upcoming meetings while giving you full control over which meetings to record. Users can chat with individual meetings or query across their entire meeting history.  

Additional features include:  
- Slack bot integration (built from scratch)  
- Project management tool synchronization (**Jira**)  
- Custom bot personalization  
- Automated action item detection  

We leverage **Next.js 15**, **TypeScript**, **Tailwind CSS 4**, **Shadcn UI**, **NextAuth**, **Prisma ORM**, **Supabase Storage**, **Inngest**, **Gemini API**, **Pinecone**, **Slack Bolt framework**, and more to provide a complete alternative to commercial solutions like Fireflies.ai and Otter.ai.
